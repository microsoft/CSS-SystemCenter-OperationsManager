# Introduction
This script is used to generate a Report for CSVs generated by the SCOM Data Collector (https://aka.ms/SCOM-DataCollector), but can potentially be used for any CSV files. **Run this script ON A MACHINE that has Excel INSTALLED.** This will use Excel PowerShell components to create a final report in Excel format.

To generate a report, all you need to do is export the **CSV** Folder from the **SDC_Results_*.zip** file into the `.\Input` folder, **OR** you can copy your zip file containing CSV's to the Input folder. The script will recursively look for CSVs in this directory. You can also set the input directory with this parameter: `-InputFolderPath`. You will notice there is an `.\Output` folder created if you do not specify a output path with: `-OutputFolderPath`

# How to Run
