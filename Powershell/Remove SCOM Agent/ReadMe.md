## SYNOPSIS
This script was designed to help with forcibly removing the SCOM Agent.


## DESCRIPTION
- If there are issues in removing the SCOM Agent, this script may be able to help forcibly remove the application from the server.
- Commands and references used in the script are taken from a SCOM 2019 agent installation and may be different in other versions.
- This is not 100% foolproof nor does it guarantee complete removal of all components, the intent is to remove as many _obvious_ references as possible so that the machine is no longer recognized to have an agent installed, or had one previously.
- This script will attempt to remove all registered services, performance counters, DLLs, and program files. This script makes direct deletions from the registry and file system.


## NOTES

- You are running this script as an Administrator
- You have exhausted other options for agent removal

- You assume all responsibility for what happens when you run this script - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
