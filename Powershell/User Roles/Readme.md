# SCOM User Role Export and Import Scripts :floppy_disk:

<sup>Published on: November 10, 2023</sup>

## Overview :mag:
These PowerShell scripts, authored by Blake Drumm, are designed for the migration and backup of custom User Roles in System Center Operations Manager (SCOM). With these tools, you can export User Roles to an XML file and then import them into another SCOM environment, streamlining transitions and ensuring continuity.

### Export Script :outbox_tray:
The export script securely gathers all custom User Role configurations from SCOM and saves them to an XML file. This script is ideal for maintaining backups or preparing for migrations to new SCOM environments.

### Import Script :inbox_tray:
The import script is intelligent and additive; it reads User Role configurations from an XML file and carefully applies them to the SCOM environment. Existing User Roles are preserved, and their configurations are updated with any new settings from the XML. New User Roles that do not exist in SCOM are created. This ensures that your current setup is not overwritten, maintaining the integrity of your SCOM configurations.

## Usage Instructions :page_with_curl:
1. **Set up the environment**: Verify that SCOM is installed and that the PowerShell environment has the necessary SCOM modules and snap-ins loaded.
2. **Run the export script**: Execute the export script to create an XML file containing the User Role configurations.
3. **Run the import script**: Use the import script on the SCOM environment you wish to update. The script will intelligently merge the XML configurations with the existing User Roles or add new ones as needed.

## Prerequisites :warning:
- Access to the SCOM Management Server.
- PowerShell with SCOM-related modules and snap-ins loaded.
- Necessary permissions to manage SCOM configurations.
